Ideas:
scale the graphs correctly #More manageable scale, but ideally it should be relative to window size or smth
divide the visible spectrum into 3 parts and equally between the 3 graphs #should they overlap?

Make plot update when changing to next file
add cases for canceling browse-dialog
make file path os safe

Known Bugs:
Program does not exit correctly when clicking the "X" in the top right
Selecting a folder with no correct fits files crashes the program
